# Exception-Handling

## Explanation:
- try block: Code that might cause an exception is placed inside this block.
- catch or except block: If an exception occurs, it is caught and handled here. In Java, the catch block specifies the exception type (e.g., ArithmeticException), while in Python, except handles specific exceptions or catches all exceptions with Exception.
- finally block: This block is optional but is executed no matter what, allowing you to clean up or perform any final operations.

## Key Points:
- Java uses try, catch, and finally blocks for exception handling.
- Python uses try, except, and finally blocks.
